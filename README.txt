Cat Oasis is a facility that gives dozens of rescued cats a beautiful cat-friendly
home. This website database will keep track of all the cats, the catâ€™s toys, the food each cat
eats, the bed provided to each cat, and employees that work there.

The UI interacts with the SQL database through HTTP requests.  SQL queries update the database
and then the updates are reflected in the UI.
